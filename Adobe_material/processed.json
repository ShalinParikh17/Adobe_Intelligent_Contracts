The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each Lender of the applicable Classes a copy of such Discounted Prepayment Notice. In connection with a Discounted Prepayment, each Lender holding the Term Loans of the applicable Classes will be entitled to specify to the Administrative Agent a discount to par (which will be expressed as a price equal to a percentage of par of the principal amount of the Term Loans held by such Lender, the “ Acceptable Discount Price ”) within the Discount Price Range for a principal amount (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Administrative Agent) of the Term Loans of the applicable Class held by such Lender at which such Lender is willing to accept such Discounted Prepayment. Each response by a Lender to a Discounted Prepayment Notice (x) will be due no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Discounted Prepayment Response Date, (y) to the extent not timely received by the Administrative Agent will be disregarded and such Lender will be deemed to have declined the Discounted Prepayment offer and (z) to the extent timely received by the Administrative Agent will be irrevocable. The Administrative Agent will provide the Discounted Prepayment Offeror with a summary of all tenders by Lenders in response to the Discounted Prepayment Notice and, based on the Acceptable Discount Prices and principal amounts of the Term Loans of the applicable Classes specified by Lenders, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Discounted Prepayment Offeror, will determine the applicable discount price (the “ Applicable Discount Price ”) for the applicable Discounted Prepayment of all Term Loans to be prepaid in such Discounted Prepayment, which will be the lower of (i) the lowest Acceptable Discount Price at which the Discounted Prepayment Offeror can complete the Discounted Prepayment for 100% of the Discounted Prepayment Amount and (ii) if the Lenders’ response is such that the Discounted Prepayment could not be completed for 100% of the Discounted Prepayment Amount, the highest Acceptable Discount Price specified by the Lenders that is within the Discount Price Range specified by the Discounted Prepayment Offeror. The Discounted Prepayment Offeror will have the right, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, to revoke in full (but not in part) its offer to make a Discounted Prepayment and rescind any Discounted Prepayment Notice therefor at its discretion at any time on or prior to the applicable Discounted Prepayment Response Date (and if such offer is revoked or notice rescinded, any failure by the Discounted Prepayment Offeror to make a prepayment to a Lender, as applicable, pursuant to this Section will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under Section 8.1 or otherwise).",

The Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise within one (1) Business Day of receipt of such notice. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.",

Upon termination of this Agreement by any party, any Collateral that has not been released by the Agent at or prior to the time of termination shall be transferred to a successor custodian or bank designated by the applicable Company and reasonably acceptable to the Agent (or, from and after receipt by the Custodian of a Notice of Exclusive Control, designated by the Agent). In the event no successor is agreed upon, the Custodian shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor custodian and shall be indemnified by each Company for any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees) relating thereto.",
